### Hey, I'm Aleksey 👋
**Senior Frontend Engineer** based in Lisbon 🇵🇹  
Previously at Yandex, now building things that hopefully don't break in production.

**About me**
- 🖥️ 8+ years turning designer mockups into pixel-perfect (or close enough) UIs
- ⚛️ Main weapons: **React**, **Vue.js**, **TypeScript** — and occasionally CSS that actually works
- 🧠 I care about architecture, UX, and code that future-me won't hate
- 🎯 I tend to take ownership — if something is broken, I'll probably fix it even if it's "not my area"
- 🇵🇹 Relocated from Moscow to Lisbon. The weather is better, the espresso is stronger
